<h1>&#9968 Markov Random Field Optimizacion using Stochactic Seach</h1>

The content of this repository served as an assignment project requested for the course Probabilistic Graphical Models at the <a href="https://www.inaoep.mx/">INAOE</a> as a student of the Master in Science in Computer Science. All the resources presented in the versions of this code were obtained from the class book that you can find in the references part. 

<strong>This application of the algorithm and information was for an only educational purpose</strong>

<h3>Description:</h3> Implement the stochastic simulation algorithm for obtaining the most probable configuration of a 1st order regular MRF considering the at least two variantes ICM and Metropolis, using MAP.
